In this chapter, we delve into the heart of machine learning through the experience of the hospital team. After a failed first attempt with an overly complex system, Victor, Marta, Luis, and Carlos learn a fundamental lesson: sometimes, the simplest solution is the most powerful.

Guided by the advice of Alma Garc√≠a of AIA, the team embarks on implementing a **linear regression** model to predict the need for medical supplies. This new approach is not only more manageable but also transparent and interpretable, gaining the trust of even the most skeptical, like Dr. Javier.

Throughout the following interactive sections, you will follow the team's steps:

1. **[Fit a Linear Regression Model]({{< relref "/Chapter 2/linear-regression/linear_regresion_game.en.md" >}})**: You will put yourself in the shoes of Marta and Luis, manually adjusting the parameters of a model to predict mask consumption.
2. **[Visualize Gradient Descent]({{< relref "/Chapter 2/linear-regression/linear_regresion_game.en.md" >}})**: You will understand the intuition behind the algorithm the team used to automatically train their model, finding the optimal parameters to minimize error.
3. **[You will compare cost functions]({{< relref "Chapter 2/error-comparison/error_comparation.en.md" >}})**: You will explore why the choice of cost function (MSE vs. MAE) was a key point in the team's discussion and how it affects model behavior.

Get ready to experience the team's challenges and discoveries, moving from theory to practice and building a solid foundation in machine learning models.
