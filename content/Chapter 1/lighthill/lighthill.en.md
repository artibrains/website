The Lighthill Report, officially titled "Artificial Intelligence: A General Survey," was an influential document published in 1973 by British mathematician Sir James Lighthill on behalf of the UK's Science Research Council. This report had a devastating impact on artificial intelligence research, particularly in the United Kingdom.

Lighthill harshly criticized the progress of AI up to that point, arguing that the grandiose promises of the previous decade had not been fulfilled and that the advances made were primarily in specific and narrow areas, lacking the progress toward general intelligence that had been promised. The report identified three categories of AI research: advanced research in automation, research in pattern recognition systems, and what it called research in "general AI" or "human-like intelligence."

The report's conclusions were particularly critical of the latter category, suggesting that AI research in general had not produced significant results and was unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future. As a direct result of the report, the British government drastically reduced funding for AI research, contributing to the onset of the first "AI winter" that lasted throughout much of the 1970s.

The full report can be found on the Chilton Computing website (http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/inf/literature/reports/lighthill_report/p001.htm).

Videos of the discussion that followed the report, known as the "Lighthill Debate," are available on YouTube and offer an interesting insight into the scientific community's reactions to Lighthill's criticisms. These videos include presentations by leading figures in the field of AI supporting the report, as well as responses from researchers who defended the potential of AI. The links to these videos are:
