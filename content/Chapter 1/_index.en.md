Minermont Hospital is on the verge of collapse. Unexpected population growth has overwhelmed its systems, generating frustration among staff and patients. In the midst of this crisis, Dr. Victor Salazar, an idealistic physician, sees a possible solution in Artificial Intelligence, but runs into the skepticism of Dr. Carmen Ledesma, an experienced and traditional professional.

This chapter chronicles the first step of their journey: a visit to the Artificial Intelligence Academy (AIA), which will change their perspective forever. Through the following interactive sections, you will explore the key concepts they discovered that laid the groundwork for the hospital's transformation.

## What Will You Learn?
Throughout this chapter, you will immerse yourself in the history of AI and its practical applications, understanding how fundamental concepts are applied in the real world.

1. **[Light and Shadow in AI]({{< relref "Chapter 1/ai-timeline/ai-timeline.en.md" >}})**: You will travel through the interactive timeline that highlights the most important milestones in the history of AI. From its beginnings to modern advances to understand how AI has evolved and overcome challenges over the decades.

2. **[Alma's Notes]({{< relref "Chapter 1/deep-blue-vs-alphago/deep-blue-vs-alphago.en.md" >}})**: Deep Blue vs. AlphaGo: You will analyze the fundamental difference between classical AI (brute force) and modern learning, a key point that Alma Garc√≠a, the director of AIA, used to illustrate the potential of new technologies.

3. **[The Lighthill Report]({{< relref "Chapter 1/lighthill/lighthill.en.md" >}})**: You will reflect on historical criticisms of AI and how these have shaped its development. You will learn that, although AI has faced challenges, its evolution has been constant and resilient.

4. **[The Cheese and Mouse Game]({{< relref "Chapter 1/cheese-mouse-game/cheese-mouse-game.en.md" >}})**: You will experiment with reinforcement learning through the same practical exercise that convinced Dr. Carmen. You will intuitively understand how a machine can "learn" from experience through rewards.

Prepare to join the Minermont Hospital team as they embark on an adventure that will lead them to question their methods, overcome their prejudices, and discover the power of artificial intelligence.
